  <LongDescription># Stash It

"Stash It" is a lightweight and efficient tool designed to ensure your game logs are preserved and organized, even after your game exits unexpectedly. Whether youâ€™re a developer debugging your game or a power user interested in reviewing detailed runtime behavior, Stash It keeps all the logs safe and accessible.

## Features

- Automatic Log Archiving: Automatically saves and compresses logs upon game exit, ensuring no critical information is lost.
- Seamless Integration: Runs silently in the background with minimal performance overhead, integrating smoothly with your game's lifecycle.
- Crash Resilience: Captures logs even during unexpected crashes, providing vital insights into game behavior at the moment of failure.

Save directory: %AppData%\..\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\.StashIt

## How It Works

When your game exits, Stash It scans predefined log directories, gathers relevant files, and compresses them into a timestamped archive. This ensures that every session's logs are securely stored for review, debugging, or archiving.

## Who Is It For?

- Game Developers: Simplifies debugging by preserving detailed runtime logs across sessions.
- QA Testers: Ensures that no issue or crash report is missing critical data.
- Power Users: Allows advanced players to review game logs and performance metrics for optimization or community reporting.</LongDescription>
