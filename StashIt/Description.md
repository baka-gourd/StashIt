## How It Works

When your game exits, Stash It scans predefined log directories, gathers relevant files, and compresses them into a timestamped archive. This ensures that every session's logs are securely stored for review, debugging, or archiving.

## Who Is It For?

- Game Developers: Simplifies debugging by preserving detailed runtime logs across sessions.
- QA Testers: Ensures that no issue or crash report is missing critical data.
- Power Users: Allows advanced players to review game logs and performance metrics for optimization or community reporting.
